# Hello-globe
Have no coding experience but keen to learn! 
So, I thought the best way is to throw myself in the deep end - to swim with the sharks, so to speak! 
I am a female in my 30s and want to learn new skills that will open up new possibilities. 
Excited? A lot! Terrified? Not really. I guess ignorance is sometimes bliss!
